## Aims and Scope

The 24th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (IEEE ICDM 2024) includes half- or full-day workshops that complement the main conference technical program, with the goal of expanding new directions and applications of data mining for both practitioners and researchers in a particular field. Accepted workshops are expected to be held on December 9th, 2024. These workshops provide a more focused, in-depth venue for presentations, discussions and interaction. Each workshop will solicit papers (max 8 pages plus 2 extra pages) for peer review. Furthermore, as in previous years, papers that are not accepted by the main conference will be automatically sent to a workshop selected by the authors when the papers were submitted to the main conference. By the unique ICDM tradition, all accepted workshop papers will be published in the dedicated ICDMW proceedings published by the IEEE Computer Society Press.

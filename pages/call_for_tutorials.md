## Aims and Scope

The 24th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (IEEE ICDM 2024) will host tutorials that focus on new research directions and initiatives. We invite proposals for tutorials from active researchers and experienced tutors. Ideally, a tutorial will cover the state-of-the-art research, development and applications in a specific data mining direction, and stimulate and facilitate future work. Tutorials on interdisciplinary directions, novel and fast-growing directions, and significant applications are highly encouraged. We also encourage hands-on-tutorials that allow attendees to learn a particular suite of tools, software and applications that are relevant to the data mining community. Software and tools should preferably be open-sourced and readily available to all participants. We note that a tutorial should not only focus on the presenters’ own previous work. In principle, the tutorial authors’ own previous work should not occupy more than 50% of the tutorial coverage. The tutorials are part of the main conference technical program and are free of charge to the registrants of the conference. 



## Format of the Submission

A tutorial proposal should be formatted into the following sections:

 - Title
 - Abstract (up to 150 words)
 - Rationale: Why do you believe this is an interesting and significant subject for the data mining and machine learning community at large? Is this tutorial or a similar one presented by the same or some authors in some other venues?
 - Content details: An outline of the tutorial in the form of a bulleted list with references and estimates for the time that will be devoted to each subject (up to 1 page).
 - Target audience and prerequisites (up to 100 words): From which areas do you expect potential participants to come? What prior knowledge, if any, do you expect from the audience? What will the participants learn? How many participants do you expect?
 - Relevance and rationale of presenting the tutorial at ICDM 2024 (up to 200 words).
 - A list of forums and their time, location, and the number of attendees (if available) if the tutorial or a similar/highly related tutorial has been presented by the same author(s) before, and a short description highlighting the similarity/difference between those and the one proposed for ICDM 2024 (up to 100 words for each entry).
 - A list of tutorials on the similar/highly related topics given by others, and a short description highlighting the differences between yours and theirs (up to 100 words for each entry).
 - Tutor’s short bio and their expertise related to the tutorial (up to 100 words per tutor).
 - Proposed length of the tutorial: please choose from: 2.5 hours (half-day) and 5 hours (full day). If you are flexible, please indicate in the outline the content that will not be included if a short tutorial is given.
 - A list of up to 30 most important references that will be covered in the tutorial.

(Optional) URLs of the slides/notes/video of the previous tutorials given by the authors, and any specific audio/video/computer requirements for the tutorial.

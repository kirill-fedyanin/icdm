For each accepted paper, at least one author is required to pay a full author registration and attend the conference to present their work on site. In case that the authors' countries/regions are still enforcing COVID-19 quarantine or travel restrictions, authors can submit a written statement from administration office (including Institution travel administration, or Dean's office, or above), to state their policy. We will then accommodate such special circumstance accordingly (detailed instructions will be sent out later). Because the conference is organized as an in-person event with all expenses being planned, the conference will offer in-person registration (i.e., no virtual-attendee registration). Early-bird Registration Fee due September 22ï¼Œ2024 for Non-Authors, or Co-Authors not registering a paper

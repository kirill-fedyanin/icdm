We invite demo contributions to the IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) 2024. The conference will take place in Abu Dhabi, UAE, from December 9 to 12, 2024.

ICDM is a leading conference dedicated to research in data mining and knowledge discovery, encompassing a wide range of topics from novel algorithms and applications to the latest advancements in data science.

The Demo Track provides a platform for researchers and practitioners to showcase their innovative and practical systems. It offers an opportunity for conference attendees to engage with and learn about new developments through interactive demonstrations. Demos must be based on fully implemented and tested systems.

Submitted demos should align with the relevant topics of ICDM, including but not limited to data mining techniques, data management, and practical applications of data science.
